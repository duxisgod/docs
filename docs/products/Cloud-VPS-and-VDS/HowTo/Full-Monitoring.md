# Learn more about your Virtual Server
We appreciate your interest in more information about your VPS.

We can offer your VPS a tool called 'Full Monitoring', which may be useful depending on your use-case.

+ at â‚¬9.99 or $11.99 per month

This Add-On gives you access to a dashboard where you can monitor your server and set alerts via e-mail or text messages (50 text messages per month included). Among other things you can monitor: server bandwidth usage directly at our switch, downtime, Apache and FTP performance.

In case of your interest, Please use your [Customer Control Panel](https://my.contabo.com/abos) to order the Add-On in the 'VPS Control' tab via the "Manage" button next to the server in question - and choose "Order Add-On". Complete the order form that appears and we will provide you with the Add-On in the next 24 hours.

We can recommend a software tool like "Munin" or "Grafana" with which you can monitor hardware and bandwidth usage.
