# Downgrading a VPS

![VPS Upgrade](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97171326/165225853-8b23b0aa-44e7-4ffc-8471-0d8777f577a3.png)


We can inform you that a **downgrade** (this technically means / is defined as a change → to a VPS which has lower storage capacity) is sadly not possible due to the underlying technical limitations. It can only be currently realized by ordering a new smaller plan on our website of the desired size:

With this new smaller plan installed, you can transfer the files from your VPS to the new
one and cancel your old  VPS on the next possible due date via your customer control
panel.

Keeping your IP is unfortunately not possible. We kindly ask for your understanding.

### Examples:
+ VPS S SSD (400GB) → VPS S NVMe (100GB) ❌
+ VPS S NVMe → VPS S SSD ✅
+ VPS S NVMe → VPS XL NVMe ✅

Use your [CCP](https://my.contabo.com/vps) to initiate an upgrade any-time.
