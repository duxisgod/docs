> We do not accept payments in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.

### Basic Rules

- Customers can choose currency independent of their location or location of their servers.
- Each customer account can only have 1 currency.
- All payments from a customer need to be sent in the currency of the customer account. If a payment is sent in a currency that does not match the currency on the customer account, it will not be accepted and will be refunded to the payer.
- The currency is fixed by the first order and cannot be changed. A customer may create a new account with a differnt currency and ask to transfer subsrciptions. Subscritpions prices will be changed to the new currency. €25 administration fee applies.
- At the moment it is not possible to pay with two / multiple credit cards in the same account.

### Potential Extra Charges

> Credit Card charges in USD are still done by a *German company* which means that some payment providers may consider payments to Contabo as a foreign transaction and may charge extra fees on customer's side, even if there is no currency conversion.


## Adjust your Payment Method

Changing your payment method is simple! Please head on over to your Contabo customer control panel at https://my.contabo.com/

Via the tab 'Payment Method' - select your desired payment method alternative.
